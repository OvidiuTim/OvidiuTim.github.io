										<h2><a href="#"> 1.Universo Potencial</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="http://universopotencial.com.br/" class="image fit"><img src="images/UP anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Universo Potencial was a freelancer job I did while living in Brazil. The purpose of the company was to promote online educational courses. The website was developed to showcase their mission, their team and the online courses available. The page was created using Elementor on Wordpress.

										<br />In worldpress I've added CSS special effects for hover, also change and define the containers using HTML for the phone interface.

										<h2><a href="#">2.smart school</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Jeff anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project was an opportunity to learn more about web development. It has a simplistic layout mostly done with HTML and CSS, Navbar with a drop-down menu, different reactive tables using JavaScript and ngx-bootstrap. The tables represented the teachers and students of a hypothetical school. Each student had a name, a phone number and a subject attributed to them, and each teacher had a subject. All this information was in an SQL server. Using Postman I made and web API so I could change details about each student and teacher. Everything was made offline with a node server. Check the code source with the QRcode.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">3.PIZZA DE CASA</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PC img1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>While living in Brazil, I owned a Pizza place and desired to create a website to present our menu and take orders from our customers. Unfortunately, this never came to be. The draft of the site was developed with a friendly interface, it has an order button that takes the visitor directly to our Whatsapp. Scrolling down is the restaurant's menu, a slideshow of the pizzas available and a short about us section with buttons for our social media. Everything was made in CSS, HTML and JavaScript. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">4.Carol Brandão</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="http://point.contato.site/diretoaoponto" class="image fit"><img src="images/CB anim.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Carol Brandão is a Brazilian life coach that sells online mentorships and courses. This project came to be from the need to collect leads for her soon to be released online course. I had to develop the design of the main page using Leadlovers, a tool already settled by the employer.

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/refour.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Is a personal project, where I wanted to develop my front end abilities. So I tried to recreate a website, it was quite the challange, but I think it looks well. When I start a project I like to try my best, and to make it look as good as possible. Made only with HTML CSS and a bit JS I think is more than decent.

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/login.gif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Is a login page, very simple, just the front end part, CSS and HTML, even if most of my project are front end I would love to learn the back end part. I have yet to learn how to do a the backend of this kind of page, all animations I did are visible</p>
